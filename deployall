# This handy script will do the following:
# 1) Build new controller stuff and deploy to minishift
# 2) Build new scanner stuff and deploy to minishift
# 3) Delete any existing scanner jobs and deploy new ones
#
# This script assumes the following:
# 1) You have a configured and working minishift instance
# 2) You are currently logged into your minishift instance
# 3) You are switched to the "insights-scan" project in your minishift instance
# 4) You have "hostfolders" setup for your minishift instance to share/load images into minishift
# 5) You have a local running docker instance
#
# You will need to define your paths and vars in "deploycontroller," "deployscanner," and "deployminishift."
# Note: It won't make your coffee for you BUT you can probably make an entire pot by the time this thing finishes
sudo echo "Running insights-ocp deployment..." # hack to cache a sudo password lolololol
